## 1) Create a dag with following tasks:
- Task to create a simple table
- Task to insert few custom values in to the created table in previous step.
- Task to select the values from the table

I have created a table as records, added few values into it and then using command line, we can see values inserted into the table.
I have also created a postgres connection for connecting with postgres.
